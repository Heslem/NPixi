- This is an RPG game that I plan to add neural networks to. They will survive in the big world, and learn many things. Of course, it is difficult to create neural networks for such a large world that I plan, but I will try and figure out how to do it, simultaneously developing the game itself

### World :city_sunset:
- I want the world to develop itself relative to the player, so that he builds himself. And so I was already able to add procedural generation of the world.

### My plan :clock3:
- Add good world generation.
- Add online.
- Add script support on LUA. (but i'm think about C#)
- Add PVP and PVE.
- Add dunguons add bosses.
